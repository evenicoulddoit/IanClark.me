      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <p>
        I have upwards of 6 years' experience delivering successful web
        solutions. I developed a passion during my teenage years, and I continue
        to love both the creativity and power of web technologies. I work
        well both individually, and as part of a team. I am a self-motivated,
        quick learner, and take great pride in my work.
      </p>

        <strong>Below</strong> is a snapshot of some of the technologies I know
        best. You'll also find a timeline of the projects I've worked on. Both

              With well over 6 years of experience, I have an
              <strong>expert</strong> understanding of HTML. In all of my work,
              I strive to create <strong>clear, concise markup</strong>. I am
              particularly excited by recent developments in the language, and
              utilise these to develop <strong>richer, semantic code</strong>
              (using micro and meta data forexample).
              In the past year, I have worked with a number HTML5 APIs,
              including <em>Offline &amp; Storage</em> (for drag and dropping),
              and <em>Performance &amp; Integration</em> (for XHR and multipart
              form data). It's no surprise that the majority of the questions I
              answer on Stack Overflow pertain to HTML problems.

              I have been using CSS since 2005, and have an
              <strong>excellent</strong> understanding of the technology. Since
              the advent of media queries in CSS3, I have been developing
              responsive layouts which look great on all viewports. My designs
              harness the extra capabilities of CSS3, allowing me to do far more
              without the need for excess DOM manipulation. I think
              <em>this page</em> is a really good example of that.

              JavaScript is both the language I have the most experience in
              (over 5 years), and the one I enjoy writing the most. I love
              developing with JavaScript to create performant, well-tested,
              object-oriented solutions.
              I have an expert knowledge of both jQuery and vanilla JavaScript,
              which has been most recently used to create a whole range of
              touch-friendly, bespoke components on the
              <a href="//www.glassesdirect.co.uk/" target="_blank">

              website (including the Pub-Sub home trial and favourites APIs,
              the infinite scroll and the product showcase interactions).

            <p>
              All of the scripts used on the GD site are tested using a
              combination of QUnit and SinonJS. These are then added
              to the CI build process through a custom Python I wrote which
              runs the tests using PhantomJS. Recently I also created my own
              test suite which parses two web pages and reports any differences
              in both the DOM and styling.
            </p>

              I also have experience of AMD (using RequireJS), and keep up to
              date with all of the planned changes in ECMAScript 6.

              Unlike many developers who learn Django, I discovered Python
              first, which enabled me to quickly get to grips with the
              framework. I really enjoy working with Django, not simply for its
              well structured MVT approach and superb documentation, but also
              because, like Python, it comes very much "batteries included".
              I have worked with Django to develop scalable, responsive
              websites.

              I have over 18 months experience of using Sass to write
              functional CSS. This page captures how effectively Sass allows
              you to abstract complex designs into easily manageable code.
              I have experience in transforming large legacy codebases into

              I have been using Python for the past three years, working with
              a number of frameworks including Django and Trac. I am a huge
              fan of the language. At CGI, I organised a number of training
              sessions for beginners, and have also participated in Dojos
              and attended Pycon UK.
            </p>
            <p>
              I find Python's combination of readability and power
              particularly refreshing, especially coming from a PHP background!

              I have over 12 months experience of Test Driven Development (TDD),
              using the practice across the entire stack. I have worked with
              <em>Qubit, SinonJS and PhantomJS</em> to develop JavaScript unit
              tests, <em>Unittest, Mock and Nose</em> to write Python
              unit/functional tests, and <em>Robot Framework and Selenium</em>
              to create end-to-end and critical path tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to this, I also wrote my own test suite to provide
              assurance that large scale refactoring hasn't changed a page's
              DOM or styling. From my experience, TDD not only reduces the
              likelihood of bugs creeping into production code, but also
              improves code quality.

              I have been using Linux for over 3 years, both in a virtual

              almost exclusively used Ubuntu (Gnome), but have also worked

              I have worked as part of a Scrum team for over 12 months - working
              in 2-week sprint cycles, using Jira to plan and develop stories,
              and taking part in daily stand-ups and end of sprint
              retrospectives. I have also worked in Kanban teams, and have found
              both techniques to be very effective, particularly when trying
              to deliver large epics.

              For the vast majority of JavaScript applications I have
              developed, I have employed jQuery to provide an essential
              abstraction layer. As the framework has developed and browsers
              have become more standards compliant, jQuery's role in JavaScript
              development has changed, and I have kept up with best practices
              throughout.

              I have years of experience working with, creating and testing

              Almost all of the technologies which I use on a daily basis are
              Open Source, and I love the aspect of community and collaboration
              that comes with it. To date, I have developed a number of plugins
              for Trac, contributed to a variety of GitHub hosted projects,
              and continually try to help others whenever possible through
              sites such as

            I developed my first website at age of 14. The intention of the site
            was clear: deliver flash games from a domain not blacklisted by the
            school's network. Although the project was entirely juvenile, it
            proved to be a life-defining venture
            <span class="note">(and was a huge success!)</span>

          <p>
            Shortly after, I began using Adobe Photoshop, and instantly found a
            passion for graphic design. This proved to be the impetus for my
            first geniune project, <em>EvenICouldDoIt.com</em>, which provided
            tutorials newcomers to graphic design. The site's popularity peaked
            in 2007, by which point it had received over 14 million hits and
            been cited by many (including a US university) as a resource of
            high quality content.

            After completing my GCSEs, I decided to take on another challenge,
            <em>Complocated.com</em>. Using much of the new-found knowledge I
            had acquired through developing <em>EvenICouldDoIt</em>
            <span class="note">(such as PHP, MySQL and JavaScript</span>), I
            aimed to build a site which provided unbiased reviews of electrical
            goods. Although I struggled to build a strong user-base, I did learn
            a lot, and I was even featured in the local paper.

            Working 6 days a week on my International Baccalaureate
            qualification, and with free time at a premium, I managed to
            complete a few more projects, including an Arts site for a teacher
            at the school, and a couple more advertising local community and
            charity events.

            At Loughborough University, I spent a great deal of time working.
            I worked as a barman, as a concierge, and still found some time to
            continue developing. The first site I worked on was
            <a href="http://xsvision.net" target="_blank">
              <em>XSVision.net</em>
            </a>,
            which at the time I intended to be the home of my own web design
            company.

          <p>
            During my holidays, I designed a site for a couple of students that
            provided bespoke fancy dress for new first years. I thoroughly
            enjoyed working on the project, and spent quite a lot of time
            meeting with the two of them to discuss ideas etc. The project was
            a great success, and I was asked to revamp the site for the
            following year.

            After leaving Loughborough University with a First class degree in
            Economics, I joined the IT multinational CGI Group (formerly
            Logica). For around 2 years, I worked as a User-interface Engineer
            for an Applications Lifecycle Management tool built on top of Open
            Source products.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this period I significantly consolidated my existing
            skills, and developed a number of new ones. I worked every
            day on a Python and Linux stack, and was introduced to Version
            Control Systems (VCS) through Subversion and Git. I developed both
            an Agile task board and backlog for the product, which drove
            the team itself to taking up Agile as a methodology.

            Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration to aid the process.
            A huge number of architectural changes have been made to the site,
            which is now faster, delivers a much better user experience
            and is entirely mobile-friendly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was fortunate enough to be heavily involved in the planning of
            every phase of the development and to have worked with a number
            of stakeholders to deliver the project on schedule.
