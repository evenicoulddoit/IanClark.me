      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <p>I have upwards of 6 years' experience working with websites. I developed a passion during my teenage years, and I continue to love the creativity and power of web technologies. I work well both individually, and as part of a team, consistently delivering successful results on time. I am a self-motivated, quick learner, and take great pride in my work.</p>
      <p><strong>Below</strong> is a snapshot of some of the technologies I know best. You'll also find a timeline of the project's I've worked on. Both elements are interactive, and you can use your keyboard to navigate between slides.</p>

            <p>With well over 6 years of experience, I have an <strong>expert</strong> understanding of HTML. In all of my work, I strive to create <strong>clear, concise markup</strong>. I am particularly excited by recent developments in the language, and utilise these to develop <strong>richer, semantic code</strong> (using micro and meta data for example). In the past year, I have worked with a number HTML5 APIs, including <em>Offline &amp; Storage</em> (for drag and dropping), and <em>Performance &amp; Integration</em> (for XHR and multipart form data). It's no surprise that the majority of the questions I answer on Stack Overflow pertain to HTML problems.</p>

            <p>I have been using CSS since 2005, and have an <strong>excellent</strong> understanding of the technology. Since the advent of media queries in CSS3, I have been developing responsive layouts which look great on all viewports. My designs harness the extra capabilities of CSS3, allowing me to do far more without the need for excess DOM manipulation. I think <em>this page</em> is a really good example of that.

            <p>JavaScript has long been one of the languages I have most enjoyed writing programs in. I have over 5 years experience, mostly in jQuery-based applications. In the past 18 months especially, I have developed some quite considerable applications, such as a live task board for Agile development, and a file uploader, both of which recruited the latest HTML5 APIs. I love the interactivity that comes with JavaScript, and I'm always looking for a challenging problem to solve with it. <a href="https://github.com/evenicoulddoit/IanClark.me/tree/master/static/src" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> View this site's JavaScript</a>.

            <p>When I began planning the stack for IanClark.me, I knew that Django had to feature. Unlike many developers who learn Django, I discovered Python first. This has enabled me to quickly get to grips with the framework, and combine Django with other powerful Python libraries such as Markdown, Pygments and BeautifulSoup, to deliver a better experience. Of note, I have found Django's URL dispatcher and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to be particularly powerful, and have recruited Flask to help manage any migrations. <a href="https://github.com/evenicoulddoit/IanClark.me/tree/master/blog" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> View this site's blog app.</a>

            <p>Sass has been a recent venture for me, but it has really opened my eyes to the powers of writing functional CSS. This page in particular, captures how effectively Sass allows you to abstract complex designs into easily manageable code. I have worked with libraries such as Compass and SingularityGS, to develop rich, responsive designs which are easily adaptable over time. One of the things I like most about Sass, is the ability to <a href="http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project" target="_blank">structure</a> your code into modules and partials, dramatically reducing the lookup time for new developers. <a href="https://github.com/evenicoulddoit/IanClark.me/blob/master/sass/partials/_experience.scss" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> View the Sass which went into this page</a>.

            <p>I have been using Python almost every day for the past two years. In this time, I have participated in Dojos, attended Pycon UK, and organised a number of Python training sessions within CGI. Coming from a PHP background, I found the clarity of the language and the Duck Typing particularly refreshing. I have knowledge of package management (Pip and Setuptools), virtualisation as well as a number of web frameworks (Django and Trac).

            <p>I have around 2 years experience of PHP use, and have <a href="http://xsvision.net" target="_blank">individually developed numerous sites using it</a> which collectively received well over 10 million hits. I have worked with libraries such as MySQLi, GD and cURL.

On this site for example, I recruit <em>keyword planning, minification</em> <span class="note">(including the Closure Compiler)</span><em>, metadata, microdata, image compression and sprites,</em> and a <em>Content Devliery Network (CDN)</em> to name a few. I work with tools such as Google's Webmasters and PageSpeed, as well as Yahoo's YSlow, to keep up with

            <p>For almost all of the JavaScript applications I have developed, I have employed jQuery to provide an essential abstraction layer. As the framework has developed, I have kept up with best practices, and I'm always looking at ways of improving my code further. I have years of experience working with a number of libraries, such as <em>jQuery UI</em> and <em>Bootstrap</em>, and I have a strong understanding of jQuery plugin development.

            <p>Almost all of the technologies which I use on a daily basis are Open Source, and I love the aspect of community and collaboration that comes with it. To date, I have developed a number of plugins for Trac which are planned to be Open Sourced, and try to help others whenever possible through sites such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1773904/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>. I aim to contribute much more the Open Source community in the future.

          <p>I developed my first website at age of 14. The intention of the site was clear: deliver flash games from a domain not blacklisted by the school's network. Although the project was entirely juvenile, it proved to be a life-defining venture <span class="note">(and was a veritable success!)</span></p>
          <p>Shortly after, I began using Adobe Photoshop, and instantly found a passion for graphic design. This proved to be the impetus for my first sincere project, <em>EvenICouldDoIt.com</em>, which provided tutorials newcomers to graphic design. The site's popularity peaked in 2007, by which point it had received over 14 million hits and been cited by many (including a US university) as a resource of high quality content.

          <p>After completing my GCSEs, I decided to take on another challenge, <em>Complocated.com</em>. Using much of the new-found knowledge I had acquired through developing <em>EvenICouldDoIt</em> <span class="note">(such as PHP, MySQL and JavaScript</span>), I aimed to build a site which provided unbiased reviews of electrical goods. Although I struggled to build a strong user-base, I did learn a lot, and I was even featured in the local paper.</p>
          <p>Working 6 days a week on my International Baccalaureate qualification, and with free time at a premium, I managed to complete a few more projects, including an Arts site for a teacher at the school, and a couple more advertising local community and charity events.</p>

          <p>At Loughborough University, I spent a great deal of time working. I worked as a barman, as a concierge, and still found some time to continue developing. The first site I worked on was <a href="http://xsvision.net" target="_blank"><em>XSVision.net</em></a>, which at the time I intended to be the home of my own web design company.</p>
          <p>During my holidays, I designed a site for a couple of students which provided bespoke fancy dress for new first years. I thoroughly enjoyed working on the project, and spent quite a lot of time meeting with the two of them to discuss ideas etc. The project was a great success, and I was asked to revamp the site for the following year.

          <p>After leaving Loughborough University with a First class degree in Economics, I joined the IT multinational CGI Group (formerly Logica). Since then I have worked as a User-interface Engineer for an Applications Lifecycle Management tool built on top of Open Source products.</p>
          <p>During this period I have significantly consolidated my existing skills, as well as developed a number of new ones. I work every day using Python and Linux (both of which I thoroughly enjoy), and have a strong understanding of Version Control Systems (VCS) such as Subversion and Git. Recently I developed both an Agile task board and backlog for our product, which has driven our project to work using this approach.
